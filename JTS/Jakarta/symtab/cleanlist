# The Clean facility looks for this file in the specified or current
# directory and removes all file matching the file specifications contained
# within using rm.exe.  There are 3 types of directives that can be
# specified:
#
#  1.rmfile(spec)                       e.g.: rmfile(*x??.*y*)
#  2.rmfile(prefix.suffix=.new_suffix)	e.g.: rmfile(*.java=.class)
#  3.rmrecursive(spec)                  e.g.: rmrecursive(savedir)
#
# The standard "*" and "?" wildcards can be used in parts of the
# specification except in the .suffix and .new_suffix of directive 2.
# Directive 1 simply removes files that match the file spec.  For each file
# that ends in the .suffix string, directive 2 removes the cooresponding
# file that ends in .new_suffix string.  Directive 3 recursively (rm -fr)
# removes files that match the file spec.  Though not shown above, multiple
# file specs can appear in any directive.
