<h3><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF"><a name="File Copying">File Copying</a></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial">It is common to have GIF or image files displayed in HTML
pages.&nbsp; XC has the capability of copying specified files in base and
extension directories into the directory where composed HTML pages reside.&nbsp;
The syntax of copy is the XC statement:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><font face="Courier New">&lt;copy FILENAME &gt;</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial">when this statement is parsed, the mentioned file is
remembered.&nbsp; When the composite file is output by XC, all
&quot;copied&quot; files are copied into the output directory as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At present, there is no provision to create subdirectories
in the output directory in which all image files reside.&nbsp; So a limitation
of XC at this time requires a base file be in the same directory as all image
files that it references.&nbsp; The same holds for extension files and their gif
files.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Another limitation of the copy command is that a FILENAME
can not have embedded blanks. (Placing quotes around filenames with blanks won't
work as XC's lexical analyzer is too stupid to understand blanks).</font></p>
