The Neighbors-List (NL) data structure is an improvement over the 
OnlyVertices or adjacency-list (AL) data structure.  Instead of
having two parallel lists, one for listing adjacent vertices and
a second parallel list for encoding edge weights, Neighbor objects
are used to encode both in different fields.  The "Neighbor" concept
is reified as an explicit class.  In general, the Neighbor-List
data structure will outperform AL, especially when dealing with 
algorithms that need edge information.  The disadvantage of this
data structure is when algorithms must manipulate edges explicitly.
