Equation: hashcmp[age, rbtree[age, malloc[]]]

Explanation:
equality predicates on attribute age are hash-qualified to improve selection performance, and all elements are stored on a red-black tree with key age in transient memory.


Equation: predindx[age()>4, odlist[age,persistent[]]]

Explanation:
 a separate, insertion-ordered doubly-linked list is maintained for elements that satisfy the predicate age()>4, and all elements are stored on a ordered doubly-linked list with key age in persistent memory.


Equation: hashcmp[age, delflag[bstree[name, malloc[]]]]

Explanation: 
equality predicates on attribute age are hash-qualified to improve selection performance, and elements are logically deleted, and all elements are stored on a binary tree with key name in transient memory.


Equation: rbtree[age, bstree[age, dlist[ dlist[ malloc[]]]]]

Precondition errors: 
   multiple rbtree/bstree layers have annotation age
   dlist is not expecting an unordered layer (dlist) above it.


Equation: dlist[ hashcmp[ age, malloc[]]]

Precondition errors: 
   hashcmp is not expecting a below-topmost layer (dlist) above it.
Prerestriction errors: 
   a retrieval layer is expected between malloc and hashcmp.


Equation: delflag[ delflag[ malloc[]]]

Precondition errors: 
   duplicate copies of a  logical_del_layer component.
   a retrieval layer is expected above malloc.


Equation: hash[age, 1000 hash[age, 2000, malloc[]]]

Parsing error: expecting "," instead of "hash"


Equation: predindx[age()>4, malloc[]]

Precondition errors: 
   a retrieval layer is expected above malloc.


Equation: hash[age, 1000, hash[age, 2000, malloc[]]]

Precondition errors: 
   multiple hash layers have annotation age


Equation: hashcmp[ name, bstree[ age, rbtree[name, odlist[name, persistent[]]]]]

Explanation: 
equality predicates on attribute name are hash-qualified to improve selection performance, and all elements are stored on a binary tree with key age, and all elements are stored on a red-black tree with key name, and all elements are stored on a ordered doubly-linked list with key name in persistent memory.
